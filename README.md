# Description
This project delves into the intricate development of embryos, tracing the emergence of diverse cell types from a single fertilized egg through a lineage tree. Despite single-cell transcriptomics providing a detailed transcriptional landscape, it does not always accurately reflect cell-lineage history. Leveraging recent advancements in simultaneous tracking of cell expression states and clonal histories, this project examines a dataset that marries whole-transcriptome profiles of cells with their clonal lineage through DNA barcoding.

We present a comparative analysis between lineage trees constructed based on clonal versus state distances, revealing significant discrepancies between inferred state and fate hierarchies. The study identifies potential confounding factors impacting the interpretations of our findings, positioning this work as a foundational proof-of-concept. The overarching goal is to juxtapose and integrate two complementary representations of cellular history, thereby uncovering insights into the differentiation process.
